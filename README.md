# Etch-a-Sketch Project

Created a Simple Etch a Sketch Project

## Logic
- Grid Layout Implementation via Flexbox
  - one loop fill the container with rows and another to fill the rows with tiles.
- Double-click toggle
  - toggles sketching 
- onMouseOver Painting
  - paints a tile with a random pastel color
